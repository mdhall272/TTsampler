# STraTUS (Software for Transmission Tree Uniform Sampling)
This utility takes as input a phylogenetic tree and, interpreting it as a pathogen phylogeny, uses it to sample uniformly from the set of compatible transmission trees. The procedure is described [here](https://academic.oup.com/mbe/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/molbev/msz058/5381076).

It is primarily intended for those interested in exploring the structure of transmission tree space, or in developing algorithms to do this.

The code is provided as an R package, with is also available through [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/STraTUS/index.html). Documentation is [here](https://cran.rstudio.com/web/packages/STraTUS/STraTUS.pdf).
